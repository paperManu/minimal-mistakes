  description: "This is a Raspberry Pi based shot & print camera, with the particularity that it is designed for self photography. The printing is done by a thermal printer which gives the image a special feeling, the whole device bringing a similar experience to what you would expect from a combination of a photo booth and a Polaroid."

  description: "An interactive installation for the fulldome of the SAT, where the user can navigate throughout the gigantic Turcot interchange. A wooden mockup of the freeway is used as an input device for the user to select his position in the virtual representation being projected on the dome. For this project, I was in charge of the tangible interface using computer vision."

  description: "A part of the show at the Montréal Planetarium, this installation by DailyTLJ asks participants to play according to rules displayed on an interactive projection, on the planetarium building. The interaction is based on the participants movement, which is captured through image analysis and tracking."

  description: "Drawing Space is an immersive telepresence installation, connecting two places together for people to draw and build a virtual world together. A 3D representation of both is done using z-cameras, the result being a color point cloud which is on one hand sent to the other participant for them to see each other in this virtual world, and on the other hand used for pose detection as the drawing is done by moving the hand freely in space."

  description: "A six meter wide cylindrical projection surface, of which a fixed projector and a rotating one enlighten the surface: the rotating projector especially acts like a torch, revealing hidden objects. Its movement is driven by an animation exported by the production software (Maya at the time), and powered by a stepper motor. Also, the projection is slightly corrected to account for the screen deformation."

  image: works/ray-on.jpg
  description: "Ray-on is a virtual reality device dedicated to cultural heritage sites, especially partially or totally destructed ones. It allows for the user to see the site as it used to be some time in the past, through a 360° rotating screen. To enhance the immersion, the current lighting environment is reproduced in the virtual scene. Four of these devices have been installed in the ancient abbaye of Cluny, in Burgundy (France). These devices were the context and one of the results of my PhD while working at On-Situ."
