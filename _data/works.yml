  description: "An interactive installation for the fulldome of the SAT, where the user can navigate throughout the gigantic Turcot interchange. A wooden mockup of the freeway is used as an input device for the user to select its position in the virtual representation being projected on the dome. For this project, I was in charge of the tangible interface using computer vision."
